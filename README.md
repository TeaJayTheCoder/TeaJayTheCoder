Hi, My name is Thomas, im very intrested in developing stuff pretaining to artifical intelegence.
I mostly develop for linux and linux based devices but if anyone wants a windows port, i can use the practice.
If you would like to fork and edit my code, please explain what you added/changed so i and others can learn from it.
I started college in 2023 for software development so my early commits and projects will not be good-quality. 
Thanks for looking at my profile!
